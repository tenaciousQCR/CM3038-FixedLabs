/**
 * This class models a path that traces the route from a root node to a node in the tree.
 * Basically it is a list of {@link ActionStatePair} objects plus a head node (of {@link State}).
 * Conceptually a path is a specialised list of action-state pairs with a head node.
 * That is why it is extending a concrete class implementing the List interface.
 * I chose {@link java.util.LinkedList} in this case. It can be any class that implements {@link java.util.List}.
 * 
 * You do not have much to do with this class.
 * A {@link Path} is return as the result when you do a search.
 * If it is not <code>null</code>, you can simply call the {@link Path#print() print()} method to print out the path.
