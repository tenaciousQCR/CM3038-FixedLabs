# How to Use these Resources
1. Open NetBeans, click 'New Project' (not 'New File') or press CTRL+SHIFT+N and choose to create a Java application (this should be the default setting)
2. Name the application. It is recommended that the 'Create Main Class' option is unchecked; a main class can be created by giving it the method `public static void main(String[] args)`.
3. Once the project has been created, drag the 'cm3038' subfolders from the 'search' folder and the lab you wish to work to the project's 'Source packages' node.
