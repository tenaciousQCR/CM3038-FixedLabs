/**
 * This class defines a node in the search algorithm.
 * Remember that a node is a book-keeping structure.
 * Apart from the state of the problem it has other attributes.
 * e.g. The parent pointer points back to the parent node so that we can trace the path when a goal is found.
 * The cost attribute is needed if we want to optimise on the cost instead of just depth of the solution.
 * The action attribute keeps track of the action which brings us to this state/node.
 * The depth attribute tells us the level/depth of this node in the search tree.
 * This is helpful if we want to limit the depth of the search (e.g. in a depth-limited search).

 * ***Update on 2015/12/03:
 * 		No longer storing cost of path in a node as it leads to a problem when another shorter path is found to the same state.
 * 		Instead of storing the cost from root to node, now we use a getCost() method to calculate the cost of the path.
 * 		This ensures that the cost in nodes are correct all the time.
 * 
 * 		Also no longer storing the depth of a node as an attribute but calculate it by a recursive method.
